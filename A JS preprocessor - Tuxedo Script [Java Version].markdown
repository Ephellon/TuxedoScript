### How to Run the Compiler
In order to run the compiler,
- unzip the zip file,
- go to your terminal,
- and run the compiler through there.

Or, if you have a Java editing app,
- import the files into a new class and simply run the compiler as an application.

_Note: this is my first Hy-Brid compiler, so feel free to leave notes/comments/critisism that will help make it better_
